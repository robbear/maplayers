There are eight large windows on this side of the 1966 addition to the hotel. Each has nine panes of glass with the central pane being the largest. I was initially concerned that the contest photograph could not have been taken from one of these windows because the window frame visible to the left in contest photograph appeared flush with the wall. The side panes of the nine-pane windows appeared too narrow for the contest photograph. This discrepancy was rectified by a hotel guest’s YouTube video which showed that the framing of the large central pane was identical to that in the contest photograph. My choice of the upper and easternmost window relied on it being relatively at the same height as the 5670 building (hotel said to be 9 stories, the insurance building 10) and the end widow allowing a wider view of the harbor than those farther west. Street views near the lone quaint house in the contest view, however, demonstrate that it could be others..","[""Canada"",""Halifax"",""Nova Scotia"",""The Dish"",""View From Your Window""]",The View From Your Window Contest: Winner #229,vfyw

To the left is a late-nineteenth century railroad car depot which is now being used for artist ateliers and various cultural events. In the far distance along the Neckar River (not visible) is the Mercedes-Benz Arena, where the local Bundesliga team plays. The area in the middle distance will be undergoing a radical transformation in the next several years because this belongs to the development site of Stuttgart 21, a controversial and very expensive project in which the current above-ground railway station will be transformed into an underground station, freeing up the immense area taken up now by tracks for new development close to the city center.","[""Europe"",""Germany"",""Stuttgart"",""The Dish"",""View From Your Window""]",The View From Your Window Contest: Winner #188,vfyw

As is customary, we began by looking for clues in the topography and architecture, but nothing immediately allowed us to narrow it down beyond being a tropical or subtropical location near the sea, perhaps with a Mediterranean flavor. My wife, however, has an astonishing talent for extracting crazy clues from these photographs, and she homed in on the palm trees in the distance, which she considered distinctive. (We are from a northern clime, so I have no explanation for her sensitivity to the finer details of palm trees). Following a bit of online botanical research, she determined that the particular species of palm trees is phoenix canariensis, which are also known as the Canary Islands Date Palm — and native to those islands.","[""Canary Islands"",""Costa Adeje"",""Santa Cruz de Tenerife"",""Spain"",""The Dish"",""View From Your Window""]",The View From Your Window Contest: Winner #243,vfyw
